EasyPQP: Simple library generation for OpenSWATH
================================================

EasyPQP is a Python package that provides simplified and fast peptide query parameter generation for OpenSWATH. It can process input from MSFragger, Sage or other database search engines in pepXML/idXML/tsv format. Statistical validation can be conducted either using PyProphet or PeptideProphet/iProphet. Retention times and ion mobilities are calibrated using an internal or external standard. In addition to a cumulative library, run-specific libraries are generated for non-linear RT alignment in OpenSWATH. For generation of PTM specific libraries that utilizes a unimod.xml database, you can further restrict the unimod.xml database file for modifications and site-specificities of interest.

Installation
============

We strongly advice to install EasyPQP in a Python [*virtualenv*](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/). EasyPQP is compatible with Python 3.

Install the development version of *easypqp* from GitHub:

````
    $ pip install git+https://github.com/grosenberger/easypqp.git@master
````

Running EasyPQP
===============

*EasyPQP* is not only a Python package, but also a command line tool:

````
   $ easypqp --help
````

or:

````
   $ easypqp convert --help
   $ easypqp library --help
   $ easypqp reduce --help
   $ easypqp filter-unimod --help
````

Docker
======

EasyPQP is also available from Docker (automated builds):

Pull the development version of *easypqp* from DockerHub (synced with GitHub):
